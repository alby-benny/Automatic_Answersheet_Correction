# Automatic_Answersheet_Correction App
An automatic answer sheet correction using multiple AI models such as the Handwritten recognition model and QA model. This is my last year project in the college. There will be a total of 3 groups working on this project and each group will be developing each AI model for this project. The dataset for the Handwritten Recognition model will be the "I am handwriting dataset" (https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/download-the-iam-handwriting-database). Since I am still a student and inexperienced in Programming, there might be a better way to do the step involved in the programs.

The backend for this project will be done in Python.
